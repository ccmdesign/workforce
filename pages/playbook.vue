            <p><strong>For a growing share of learners and workers in the United States, college is failing to live up to its economic mobility promise.</strong> The cost of college is rising, accompanied by mounting student debt, and many graduates are underemployed following college. Students face steep barriers to college enrollment and success, including time demands, access to housing and childcare, and transportation. These conditions have prompted many learners and workers to reconsider whether college is truly worth the expense.</p>
            <p><strong>Higher education leaders are facing a moment of reckoning in which they must improve the economic returns of a college education.</strong> However, there is little clarity around which programs and initiatives best improve a student’s earnings and employment later in their career. The dearth of information reflects, at least in part, the lack of attention and resources such programs have received from the majority of post-secondary institutions.</p>
            <p><strong>This white paper puts “college-to-jobs” programs in focus, making the case that they should be a priority for future policy, investment, and research.</strong> It maps the field of initiatives that smooth transitions for college students to the workforce, identifying 13 “interventions” that have been deployed to improve college students’ economic outcomes.</p>
            <p>The Playbook provides answers to a crucial question at a time of inflection for postsecondary education: <strong>what can we do to launch more college students onto successful career trajectories?</strong></p>
